Our project is dedicated to addressing the challenges associated with developing a robust Hospital Management System. This system aims to streamline various aspects of hospital operations, including appointment scheduling, patient registration, electronic health records management, inventory control, billing and payment processing, staff management, emergency response coordination, real time patient monitoring with alerts, interoperability with external systems, and adherence to healthcare regulations. Through these features, our goal is to enhance the efficiency of hospital procedures, improve patient care delivery, and optimize resource allocation within healthcare facilities.
